        <h3>About the Project</h3>
      </div>
        <div class="description" id="about">
          <p>The GIRRL study, which uses novel bio-behavioral measures such as probabilistic learning tasks, eye tracking, and oral glucose tolerance 
             tests, aims to better understand how the brain and body direct behavior. This research requires the development and integration of novel 
             hardware and software to gather data, as well as computational methods to analyze the data. This dual-pronged project combines 
             computational research, advancement of computational learning, and outreach between the University of Wyoming (UW) and Central Wyoming College (CWC). 
             The overall goal of this project is to further develop and support computational and computer science learning and research at UW and 
             CWC using an active research project.</p>
          <p><b>Aim 1:</b> Implement hardware and software development for the GIRRL study into the Software Development 
             Skills II course at CWC.</p>
          <p><b>Aim 2:</b> Develop a data analysis pipeline in Python for the GIRRL study.</p>

        <div class="description">
        <p>To engineer a computer-controlled electro-mechanical device that reliably and consistently dispenses a single piece of candy and 
           reports when the candy is taken, we will utilize collaborative efforts and skills in areas such as 3D design/printing, software 
           development, electronic design/assembly, quality assurance, and documentation. We aim to produce a unit that is easy to use, 
           maintain, and operate consistently. These efforts will support the success of research in growth insulin resistance and 
           reinforcement learning, as well as offer opportunities for use in other research projects.</p>
